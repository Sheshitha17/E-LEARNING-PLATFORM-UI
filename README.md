The objective of this task is to design and develop the front-end of a multi-page e-learning platform using HTML, CSS. The interface should provide a smooth, responsive, and visually engaging experience for learners. The platform must include the following key components: a home page that introduces the platform and its features, a course listing page showcasing available courses with thumbnails and brief descriptions, a course detail page that embeds a video lecture using a platform like YouTube, and a dashboard page that displays the user's course progress with visual progress bars. Navigation links should be present on every page to allow seamless browsing. The design must be responsive, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This task focuses on creating a styled, interactive front-end ready to be connected to a backend system in the future. The final deliverable is a complete, well-structured, multi-page user interface for an e-learning experience.
